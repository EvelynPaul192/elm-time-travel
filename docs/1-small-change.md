# Part 1: Make a small change

Change something in either Mario or Asteroids. It needs to be something bigger than just changing the colors or the physics constants, but it doesn't need to be anything huge. Here are some suggestions:

- Make it so that Mario or the asteroids bounce off the side of the screen instead of wrapping around.
- Add a jump counter that shows how many times Mario has jumped, or a shot counter that shows how many times the ship has fired. (You can use a `words` element in the view to display it.)
- Make it so that there is an orange rectangle of lava near Mario, and Mario has to jump over it.
- Make it so that the astroids all pull on each other with gravity.
- Make all the asteroids different colors. (This one is surprisingly difficult!)

These are just suggestions to get you thinking. I encourage you to experiment and come up with your own ideas as well! Donâ€™t overcomplicate it, however. The goal here is to get a feel for Elm, not to make the Next Great Video Game Hit.

You will find the [documentation for the Elm Playground module](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/evancz/elm-playground/latest/Playground) useful. Note that these games use the `game` application builder function in `Playground` (as opposed to `picture` or `animation`).

Once you have made your change and tested it, **commit your work**. Please make sure that this change ends up in a commit of its own, separate from part 2!
